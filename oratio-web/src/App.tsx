// App.tsx is now significantly simpler.
// The main routing logic is handled in main.tsx using createBrowserRouter.
// Layout.tsx renders the main structure (Header, Footer) and includes <Outlet />
// which RouterProvider uses to render the matched child route components (pages).

// You might keep this file for context providers, global state setup,
// or other logic that needs to wrap the entire application,
// but for basic routing setup as described, it might not be strictly necessary
// beyond being potentially used by the router configuration itself (e.g., error boundaries).

// For now, we can leave it empty or with minimal structure if needed later.
// Let's remove the old routing code.

import React from 'react';
import './App.css'; // Keep App specific styles if any

function App() {
  // The RouterProvider in main.tsx now controls rendering.
  // This component might not even be directly rendered depending on router setup.
  // If Layout is the root element in the router, this App component might become redundant
  // unless used for wrapping providers or other top-level concerns.
  // For this task, we assume Layout is the primary element in the router.
  return null; // Or return <>{/* Context Providers if needed */}</>
